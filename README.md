In version one, I needed this for work which is a .Net Framework project with the old packages.config style references. It is on my to do list to also compare .deps.json files in a future version, if I ever need it.

Let me know if there are other features needed, such as updates to Versions or Target Frameworks for packages.

This project uses two of my projects:
DataJuggler.Win.Controls
DataJuggler.UltimateHelper
