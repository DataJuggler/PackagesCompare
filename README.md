In version one, I needed this for work which is a .Net Framework project with the old packages.config style references. It is on my to do list to also compare .deps.json files in a future version, if I ever need it.

Let me know if there are other features needed, such as updates to Versions or Target Frameworks for packages.

This project uses two of my projects:
DataJuggler.Win.Controls<br />
DataJuggler.UltimateHelper

If you like regions, which most of you don't, the project also was regionized using Regionizer.
